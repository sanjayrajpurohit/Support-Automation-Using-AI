# Support-Automation-Using-AI
This project is an AI-powered support automation system built entirely in Python using Flask and Natural Language Processing (NLP). It automates user support by extracting relevant information from SOP documents and generating intelligent, context-aware responses. The system reduces manual workload, improves response time, and enhances user experience by delivering instant solutions with an option for escalation.

✨ Features

Automated support using NLP-based query understanding
SOP document parsing for accurate cause and solution extraction
Hybrid intelligence: rule-based + AI fallback model
Logging of user interactions for analysis and improvement
RESTful API for query handling and document access
Lightweight, scalable, and platform-independent
Future-ready for database, multi-user, and model upgrades
